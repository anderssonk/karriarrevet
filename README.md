# Karriärrevet

Karriärrevet is an annual programme and chapter fair which offers meetings between degree- and master’s students at the Chapter of Media Technology at KTH. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event had to be digitalised. 

This is a new, digital venue in place for the traditional event.
